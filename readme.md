This is the StarTeam plugin for IntelliJ IDEA. JetBrains is no longer 
developing or maintaining the plugin, so if you'd like to use the
StarTeam integration, you're welcome to build this from source and
hack on it to improve the functionality.

The code has been updated for compatibility with IntelliJ IDEA 10.5.

You need to place starteam-sdk.jar to the lib folder in order to build 
the plugin.
